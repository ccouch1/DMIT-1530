                    <h2>1. “A logo derives meaning from the quality of the thing it symbolizes,not the other way around.”</h2>
                    <p>Designers sometimes talk about logos as if they were responsible for conveying meaning by themselves and, hence, the success or failure of a logo is a factor of the design. Rand never assigned such importance or responsibility to a
                        logo:
                    </p>

                    <p><em>“It is only by association with a product, a service, a business, or a 
                    corporation that a logo takes on any real meaning. If a company is second 
                    rate, the logo will eventually be perceived as second rate. It is foolhardy to 
                    believe that a logo will do its job immediately, before an audience has been 
                    properly conditioned.”</em></p>

                    <p>This doesn’t mean that logos are insignificant — it means logos are free. They bear the burden only of marking, not meaning. This brings us to the second principle.</p>

                    <h2>2. “The only mandate in logo design is that they be distinctive, memorable and clear.”</h2>
                    <p>In other words, logos can look like whatever they want. They don’t have to directly depict anything about the company they represent. In fact, sometimes it’s better when they don’t! As Rand puts it:</p>

                    <p><em>“Surprising to many, the subject matter of a logo is of relatively little 
                    importance, and even appropriateness of content does not always play a 
                    significant role.</em></p>

                    <p><em>“This does not imply that appropriateness is undesirable. It merely indicates that 
                    a one-to-one relationship between a symbol and what it symbolized is very often 
                    impossible to achieve and, under certain conditions, objectionable. Ultimately, the 
                    only mandate in the design of logos, it seems, is that they be distinctive, 
                    memorable, and clear.” </em></p>

                    <h2>3.“presentation is key”</h2>
                    <p>Rand placed great importance on the act of presenting a design to a client. For each design, a designer must tell a unique story that is tailored to the client.</p>

                    <p><em>“How to present a new idea is, perhaps, one of the designer’s most 
                    difficult tasks. Everything a designer does involves presentation of 
                    some kind–not only how to explain (present) a particular design to an 
                    interested listener (client, reader, spectator), but how the design may 
                    explain itself in the marketplace…”</em></p>

                    </h2>

                    <p>If you truly understand what a logo is and is not capable of doing, then your designs will always have the simplicity that we all celebrate.</p>
