                    We’re done arguing over the importance of web standards. Accessibility, stability, quality control, and ease-of-use all helped
                    to settle the debate long ago. Advocacy websites created to promote web standards—such as Chris Heilmann's
                    <a href="http://icant.co.uk/webstandardsforbusiness/pmwiki.php">Web Standards for Business</a> and <a
                        href="http://www.webstandards.org/learn/faq/">The Web Standards Project</a>—haven't needed to change
                    at all since the mid-2000s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What <em>has</em> changed, however, is the way standards are developed—an issue arguably as important
                    as the standards themselves. The next community debate, then, isn't about web standards; it's about how
                    web standards should be standardized.
                </p>
                <h2>What's in a standard?</h2>
                <p>
                    The idea that standardization is important is reflected in the language we use to describe our projects and communities.
                    For example, the <a href="http://jsonapi.org/">JSON API</a> homepage states that
                    it is a “Standard for building APIs in JSON.” The FAQ page <a href="http://jsonapi.org/faq/">describes JSON API as a specification</a>,
                    and developers are talking about its use <a href="https://twitter.com/ag_dubs/status/552225694403813377">in terms of compliance</a>.
                    A competing project, <a href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html">HAL</a>, references the visual
                    language of standardization on its website—the flow of the page reminiscent of a formal Request For Comment,
                    before directing you to the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-06">actual Internet Engineering Task Force RFC</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These projects illustrate a conflation of ideas about standards, which, left unaddressed, can lead to confusion. Both the
                    JSON API specification and the HAL specification are <i>de facto</i> standards—an
                    idea for a best practice approach to a common-use problem that is spreading organically through the developer
                    community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The specifications we tend to think of more commonly, such as those for HTML and JavaScript, are <i>voluntary consensus</i>                    standards, meaning that international standards-setting bodies and industry consortia have agreed to
                    work on and adopt these specifications, and create incentives for their implementation. But even in a
                    voluntary consensus environment, differences of opinion can split a technology—JSON (not to be confused
                    with JSON API) actually has two competing voluntary consensus specifications: one with the standards
                    group <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-404.pdf">Ecma</a>, the
                    other with IETF.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the term “standard” is used here in all cases, all specifications are not created equal. We sometimes even see RFCs
                    for technical specifications that will never become standards because they are theoretical ideas for
                    how something <em>might</em> work; ergo, all standards will have specifications,
                    but not all specifications are standards.
                </p>
                <h2>Making standards</h2>
                <p>
                    “Official” standards are specifications that have gone through a process of voluntary consensus. There is potentially a clear
                    path for projects to evolve from a de facto specification to one that is standardized through voluntary
                    consensus:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Developer identifies problem and proposes solution to peers;</li>
                    <li>Peer community provides feedback and proposes potential alternate solutions in public channels like GitHub
                        or Google Groups;</li>
                    <li>Peer community reaches mass consensus and hands specification off to a standards body;</li>
                    <li>Developers implement solution while the standards body formalizes and legalizes the standard.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Most developers I know are smart, resourceful, and prefer the path of least resistance; thanks to the <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law">all bugs are shallow</a> mentality of the OSS community,
                    they're inclined to work together to solve issues of mutual concern. This is a fairly straightforward,
                    not-at-all-new idea, and <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">The Extensible Web Manifesto</a>                    is essentially a call to action to implement more developer feedback on this very process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's exciting to think that the next official web standards might come from the developer community, but in practice this
                    path to official standardization has been obfuscated. The <a href="http://responsiveimages.org/">Responsive Images Community Group</a>                    experienced this firsthand when it proposed a specification for the <code>picture</code> element—noting
                    an issue with the way HTML handled responsive images, the RICG proposed a developer-built, de facto solution
                    to the <a href="https://whatwg.org/">Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</a>, maintainers
                    of the “living” HTML standard. In a <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-images-and-web-standards-at-the-turning-point">well-documented</a>                    series of events, WHATWG practically dismissed the developer solution in favor of a vaguely specified
                    solution they created over the course of a few days. If it weren't for the passion and persistence of
                    the community and of RICG leadership, the developer solution would've been defeated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The RICG specification was ultimately accepted by WHATWG and the W3C, but the experience of the standardization process certainly
                    left a bad taste in developers'' mouths. It would be easy enough to focus our attention on improving
                    this process for community groups like RICG, and the web would certainly be a better place for developers
                    if we did so—but wouldn't it be nice if we could define standardization not as “a process that makes
                    technology,” but as “a process that makes agreements about technology”?
                </p>
                <p>
                    In reality, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard">open standardization</a> is a fundamentally
                    power-laden and political process, and it's making its way into how we think about Open Source project
                    and community governance. Put in the terms of <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/index.html">Eric Raymond's seminal essay</a>,
                    we've built web technologies in the bazaar-style of the open source development ethos, but standardizing
                    those technologies is a cathedral-building activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we seek to standardize technology, we need to recognize the tension inherent in building cathedrals that will later become
                    central authorities for us to reject. Our challenge is to find the balance between capitalizing on the
                    benefits of standardization processes without eroding our community ideals. Thankfully, there are long
                    histories of standardization efforts in other industries and communities that can provide insight for
                    standardizing the web.
                </p>
                <h2>Old models for modern standards</h2>
                <p>
                    Open source communities can learn a lot from the histories and governance models of different standards organizations—indeed,
                    web standards consortia like Ecma International and the W3C already have similar organizational structures,
                    but it's helpful to understand the prior art upon which we are laying our community standards-setting
                    foundation. After all, the “keep what works” mentality only works in the long run if you understand why
                    it works in the first place.

                <p>
                    The ideological origins of web standards bodies come from early efforts to standardize telegraphy and engineering in the
                    19th century, through committees such as the <a href="http://www.asce.org/">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>,
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASME">American Society of Mechanical Engineers</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Institute_of_Electrical_Engineers">American Institute of Electrical Engineers</a>.
                    Many hosted regular “congresses”—Victorian-era precursors to today's web development conferences—that
                    helped to create standards and to further define the identity of the professional engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As engineering disciplines began to overlap, it became clear that cooperation between these industrial societies would be
                    necessary, so in 1918 the American Engineering Standards Committee was formed to encourage cooperation
                    and coordination of standards across groups. The resulting structure was an “organization of organizations”
                    that facilitated consensus-building among multiple engineering organizations, each comprised of a diverse
                    pool of engineers from a diverse set of companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, the AESC is known as the American National Standards Institute, but its 100-year-old model of governance—rife with
                    community crises and ideals—is reflected in web standards groups. Then, as now, organizational disputes
                    often arose between “shop culture” practitioners and “school culture” academics. A certain amount of
                    tension between groups is healthy for moving ideas forward, and these early groups evolved organizational
                    means for creating and releasing tension as necessary. Today’s default response to disputes in open-source
                    software is to fork the specification in question, producing a network of rival camps who are incentivized
                    to emphasize differences instead of areas of agreement.
                </p>
                <h2>When ideals compete</h2>
                <p>
                    “Openness” is a core ideal in the Open Web community, as well as something of a polluted word. The rhetoric of openness is
                    meant to communicate a favorable set of values, and those values often depend on the speaker and the
                    audience. In his book <cite><a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/history/twentieth-century-american-history/open-standards-and-digital-age-history-ideology-and-networks">Open Standards and the Digital Age</a></cite>,
                    Professor Andrew Russell notes that “for individuals, ‘open’ is shorthand for transparent, welcoming,
                    participatory, and entrepreneurial; for society at large, open signifies a vast increase in the flow
                    of goods and information through a global, market-oriented system of exchange.” In the absence of a single
                    definition that suits all parties, we tend to take “open” to mean “inclusive of everything.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Standardization, on the other hand, is often a process that defines what something <em>is</em> in terms
                    of what it <em>is not</em>. Russell notes that the broader societal goal of standardizing technology
                    is to create a “cohesive and flexible network” that can sustain complex social and economic activity.
                    Thus, the process of making standards means incorporating a wide range of practices and ideas with political,
                    economic, and cultural dimensions—all of which may be of strategic importance to creators, implementors,
                    end users, and the general public. Put this way, standards are technically-oriented instances of diplomacy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In establishing the ISO subcommittee for developing open working standards in 1977, Charles Bachmann noted that “the adjective
                    ‘open’ means to imply that all participants come to the system as equal partners.” In reality, participants
                    don't often come to the table as equal partners—the OSI's own progress was stymied by organizational
                    power plays and the growth of a competing technology, TCP/IP. But equality as an ideal of open standards-making
                    has remained. This ideal is rooted in a deeply held opposition to centralized power, which, according
                    to Russell, is reflected in the histories of many standards-setting organizations. Upholding this vision
                    of equality and achieving successful implementation meant, at times, hiding conflicts and issues from
                    those outside the meeting room—not exactly the transparent behavior one might expect from an “open” system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If standards really are agreements between equal parties, then the agreement is the controlling authority. And if standards-setting
                    is a rejection of centralized control, then the standardization process becomes one of <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">creative destruction</a>. It's the ideological
                    circle of open-standards-making life: a group makes a consensus standard on some technology; as the standard
                    circulates, a new party arises to point out a flaw or an unconsidered use case for the existing standard.
                    The original group then has to make room for the new party and rework the standard, or else face rejection
                    of the group and the standard. In rejecting the original group, the offended party forms a competing
                    group and standard, and the cycle begins anew.
                </p>
                <h2>It's complicated</h2>
                <p>
                    It's a tangled web we weave standardizing the Open Web—political, economic, and social relationships between people, technologies,
                    companies, and industry groups are difficult to ascertain at a glance. On closer inspection, one can
                    see that these organizations and communities are complex systems forming a complex network—so complex
                    that I was compelled to create this <a href="http://www.joryburson.com/standardization-project/">interactive Open Standards network graph</a>                    to help keep it all straight as I researched.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we rush off to create a complex, decentralized network of open source standards groups, it probably warrants mentioning
                    that complex systems fail 100% of the time. A decentralized network may let us fail smaller in most cases,
                    but the key to longevity of the system is failing smart—and if the research has taught me anything, it's
                    that standardization fails on the human, not the technological, element. For better or worse, complexity
                    is not viral—so to mitigate this, we need to make the complexity of the standardization system consumable
                    without abstracting away meaningful parts of the process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the absence of community coordination, methodless enthusiasm will ensue—and caught somewhere in the Bermuda triangle of
                    competing standards bodies, implementers, and OSS maintainers is the developer community. If we want
                    our community-driven projects to become official, internationally recognized standards, we need to understand
                    the impact of our governance processes as well as we understand the technical specifications for our
                    technologies.
